#Hands-on-Go
Example Project for learning GoLang

# Cards Project
    This project is a simple example project to implement a simulation of real life Cards game. Which basically involves
    1. Creating a new 'deck'
    2. Deal with a 'deck' with a specific hand
    3. Shuffle a 'deck'

    Besides simulating the above mentioned functionlity our project also includes the basic concept of Testing in Go. Basic Test file for this project is 'deck_test.go'

# Structs Project
    This project is demonstration of the 'struct' type of Go. And Also covers the use of pointer in Go. Detailing out the pass by value and pass by reference paradigm.
    # NB: Go is a 'pass by value' language
    # Value Types of Go are : int, float, string, bool, struct

# MAP Project
    This project demonstrate the use of 'map' in Go. Different ways of creating a map of {key:value} type. Various operations with 'map'.
    1. 'delete' on 'map'
    2. Iteration over a 'map'
    # NB: 'map' is of refenrence type. As a result any change of a instance variable of type 'map' that comes as a parameter of a function will change the main variable that is being sent to the method.

# INTERFACES Project
    This project demonstrate the use of 'interface' in Go for better data handshaking.

    # NB: Here some notes on 'interface' in Go
        1. Interfaces are not generic types.
        2. Interfaces are 'implicit'.
        3. Interfaces are a contract to help us manage types. { GARBAGE IN -> GARBAGE OUT }
        4. Interfaces are tough. Step #1 is understanding how to read them.{ Reading from Standard Library Documentation }
# http Project
    This project demonstrate the use of on of the most popular package of Go. Namely the 'http' package. Implementations are done to get a
    better understanding of interfaces in Go.
# Assignment2 Project
    This project contains the solution for the Assignment2 on Interface of the course of Udemy.
# Assignment2 Hard Project
    This project contains the solution for the Assignment2 (Hard) on Interface of the course of Udemy.
