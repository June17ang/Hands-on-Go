# Hands-on-Go
Example Project for learning GoLang

# Cards Project
    This project is a simple example project to implement a simulation of real life Cards game. Which basically involves
    1. Creating a new 'deck'
    2. Deal with a 'deck' with a specific hand
    3. Shuffle a 'deck'

    Besides simulating the above mentioned functionlity our project also includes the basic concept of Testing in Go. Basic Test file for this project is 'deck_test.go'

# Structs Project
    This project is demonstration of the 'struct' type of Go. And Also covers the use of pointer in Go. Detailing out the pass by value and pass by reference paradigm.
    # NB: Go is a 'pass by value' language
    # Value Types of Go are : int, float, string, bool, struct

# MAP Project
    This project demonstrate the use of 'map' in Go. Different ways of creating a map of {key:value} type. Various operations with 'map'.
    1. 'delete' on 'map'
    2. Iteration over a 'map'
    # NB: 'map' is of refenrence type. As a result any change of a instance variable of type 'map' that comes as a parameter of a function will change the main variable that is being sent to the method.
